# python-card-games
Fun project to practice programming in python. Specifically:

- learn and implement python package structure
- refresh Python basics
- implement argparse and command line functionality
- automated in-code documentation in PyCharm, and automated package documentation with sphinx

Poker
=====
Disclaimer: Offical poker rules are not implemented, as I don't know how to play properly! The (probably incorrect) rules that I use 
with mates will be fully implemented however. (eg. no minimum raise.)
