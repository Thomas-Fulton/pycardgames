Fun project to practice python programming. Specifically:

- package structure
- refresh Python basics
- argparse and command line functionality
- automated documentation with Sphinx and PyCharm

Poker
=====
Disclaimer: Proper poker rules are not implemented, as I do not know them! The (probably incorrect) rules that I use 
with mates however will be fully implemented. (eg. no minimum raise.)
